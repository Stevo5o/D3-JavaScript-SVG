      <b>What Front End Engineers actually do:</b>
      <ol>
         <li>Establish a visual language between Designers and Engineers</li>
         <li>From a Visual Design, define a set of components that represent content, brand, features, etc.</li>
         <li>Establish a baseline for the Web Application in terms of conventions, frameworks, requirements, visual languages and specs.</li>
         <li>Define the scope of the Web Application in terms of devices, browsers, screens, animations.</li>
         <li>Develop a Quality Assurance guideline to ensure brand fidelity, code quality, review of product by stakeholders.</li>
         <li>Style the Web Application with proper spacings, typography, headings, face fonts, icons, margins, paddings, grids and so on.</li>
         <li>Style the Web Application with multiple resolution images, device oriented mockups, all while taking care of design guidelines.</li>
         <li>Markup the Web Application taking into account semantics, accessibility, SEO, schemas and microformats.</li>
         <li>Connect to an API to retrieve information in a friendly, non-battery consuming, device and client aware way.</li>
         <li>Develop client side code to perform smooth animations, transitions, lazy loading, interactions, application workflows, most of the time taking into consideration progressive enhancement and backwards compatible standards.</li>
         <li>Ensure Backend connections are secure, taking Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) procedures into account, protect against Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF).</li>
         <li>Never forgetting that despite strict deadlines, stakeholders requests, and device limitations, <strong>the User is, and will always be first</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In order to achieve aforementioned goals, Front End Engineers use many tools that range from Visual Design tools (Photoshop, Adobe, Macaw, Sketch), to Programming Tools (IDE&#8217;s, Command Line, Source Version Control, Bash scripts, Build tasks). Sometimes we even have to take care of Marketing (Newsletters, Campaigns, Analytics, SEO, Social Media), UX (animations, transitions, feedback, interfaces, visual language) to Content tweakes (breakpoints, avoiding orphan words, readability, colors).</p>
